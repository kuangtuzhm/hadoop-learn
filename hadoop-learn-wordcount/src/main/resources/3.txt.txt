The input types are controlled via the input format, which we have not explicitly set
because we are using the default TextInputFormat.
After setting the classes that define the map and reduce functions, we are ready to run the
job. The waitForCompletion() method on Job submits the job and waits for it to finish.
The single argument to the method is a flag indicating whether verbose output is
generated. When true, the job writes information about its progress to the console.
The return value of the waitForCompletion() method is a Boolean indicating success
(true) or failure (false), which we translate into the program¡¯s exit code of 0 or 1.
