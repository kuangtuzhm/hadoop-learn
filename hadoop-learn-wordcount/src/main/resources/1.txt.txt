After writing a MapReduce job, it¡¯s normal to try it out on a small dataset to flush out any
immediate problems with the code. First, install Hadoop in standalone mode (there are
instructions for how to do this in Appendix A). This is the mode in which Hadoop runs
using the local filesystem with a local job runner. Then, install and compile the examples
using the instructions on the book¡¯s website.
